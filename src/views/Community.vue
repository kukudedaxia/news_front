    <h1>Community Rule</h1>
    <p>
      Beeto is a platform where everyone can get the newest update of what is happening around us in
      the shortest time. With our roots in the culture and Internet ecosystem of the Arab world, our
      goal is to connect Arabic language creators with their users, to establish a diverse and
      extensive community connection, so that 450 million Arabic speakers have convenient and equal
      access to information and connect with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Beeto, you can not only get information, but you can also be the "information". Everyone
      can make their voice to be heard by the whole world via our platform. People can feel more
      closer and communicate easier with each other on our platform. And we will also find a more
      effective and efficient way to connect people with a wealth of valuable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve our goal of establishing one of the largest social media platform in the Arabic
      region, Beeto will keep producing high-quality, precipitable information. Meanwhile, we will
      also try our best to help people share their knowledge, experience and insights in a friendly
      environment. The below Community Rules are meant as a guide to what we ask from our Beeto
      users but are not meant to be a comprehensive nor a complete guide to the rules and
      regulations of posting content. We ask that all Beeto users follow these Community Rules to
      ensure every Beeto user’s voice is heard and at the same time keeping the Beeto platform
      community supportive and safe for all users. These rules do not deal with how we collect, use
      and share your personal information. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for details.

      <h2>Usage Rules</h2>
      <div class="no-indent">
        <p>
          1. After the user is successfully registered, Beeto will give each user a user account and
          corresponding password. The user account and password should be kept by the user; the user
          should be legally responsible for all activities and events conducted with his user
          account, including compliance with Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The user should make sure the information of registration is authentic, legal and valid
          in Beeto. The user cannot use another person’s identity to register; should not share any
          content in the name of another person; should not maliciously use the registered account
          to cause other users to misunderstand; otherwise Beeto has the right to immediately stop
          providing services, block the account, and the user needs to take full responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If users register with the names of well-known people or organizations (without
          verification), Beeto has the right to withdraw the usernames.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Beeto is a platform for sharing, disseminating and acquiring information. The
          information published by users through Beeto is public information, and other third
          parties can obtain the information published by users through Beeto. The information is
          public information and the publisher should know about this; any information that users do
          not want to be known to the others should not be published on Beeto.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The user promises not to directly or indirectly engage in acts that violate laws and
          social ethics in any way in any jurisdiction via Beeto, and Beeto has the right to delete
          content or block the accounts that violate the above commitments.
